Milestone #3 â€“ Read through the case study again, and determine what information, retrieved from the tables
(basically a report), will be helpful in making the business decisions listed in the case study. There should
be a minimum of three reports.  Provide a description of the report, write the Python script to create the
report, and take a screenshot of each report (result of query). The deliverables this week are: The Python
script(s) and a Word document that has your group name at the top, members of the team, description of the
reports, and screenshot(s) of the results of running the queries.
